Introduction
============
KD Reports is a Qt tool that lets you easily create printable reports by
providing all of the necessary features for a variety of applications.
Reports can be created programmatically, using an easy to use C++ API, or they
can be data-driven, creating reports from XML or SQL data sources complete with
watermarks, headers and footers. Reports can be previewed manually, sent
directly to a printer, or saved as PDF files.
